            <h2 class="name">Mary Malone</h2>
            <p>Ever since Mary was young, her passion in life was to grow up and brew the most elegant beers. </p>
            <h2>Rachel Malone</h2>
            <p>Rachel did not take to crafting beers until after she graduated from college.</p>
            <h2>Karelee Malone</h2>
            <p>
                Along with Mary, Karelee had always felt like something was missing in her life. After receiving her Masters in Business Administration, she knew her next step was to open a brewery with her sisters.
