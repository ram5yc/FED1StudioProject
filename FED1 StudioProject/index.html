        OUR STORY
    </h1>
    <p>

        Brewergy is a Restaurant Group that was founded with a thirst for great craft beer In the spring of ‘94, we filtered our first batch of Stellar Nightshade, thereby beginning our journey to help build our business in Kansas City's dining and drink hot spot.

        The Tavern, a comfortable place to hang out,  play pool, dine and drink with friends opened in October of 2005. Award-winning fresh craft beersthat can be enjoyed on a seasonal patio is one of our customers favorite places to sit and drink.

        Yahtzee, Kansas City’s first true gastropub, features a carefully curated beer list with award-winning beer selections.
